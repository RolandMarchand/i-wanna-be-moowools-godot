# I Don't Wanna Be Game Maker
This is a Godot project template for Aiwana games. This template expects some Godot literacy from the developer, except for basic game types such as needle.

This template includes...
* The Kid
* Platforms
* Tilemaps of base tiles and spikes
* Saves
* Music
* Sprites
* Sounds and musics

Feel free to play with and modify this template. Add your own custom scripts, encounters, bosses, attack patterns and more!
