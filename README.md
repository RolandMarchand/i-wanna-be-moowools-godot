# Moowool's Godot
This framework has been developped as a free and open source alternative to Godot developers and Linux users. 

Moowool's Godot, based on the HTML5 Renex Engine, plans to be faithful to the Aiwana Community' standards, but admits that there are some fundamental differences between Game Maker and Godot and aims for a "close enough" gameplay compatiility.

It omits some elements like missing pixels in GM's hitboxes, or some maneuvers like the two blocks trick, so this port isn't optimal for L Needles, but is wonderful for adventure and avoidance games.

This template expects some Godot literacy from the developer.

Feel free to play with and modify this template. Add your own custom scripts, encounters, bosses, attack patterns and more!

THIS FRAMEWORK IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND ISN'T READY FOR PRODUCTION.
